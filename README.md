## Overview
This project consists of UX research to increase the usability and user satisfaction of mobile D&amp;D character sheets on the basis of dndbeyond.com. 

The project succeeded by creating a high-fidelity prototype that scored a near-perfect 6.09 out of 7   on the [USE questionnaire](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230786746_Measuring_Usability_with_the_USE_Questionnaire). The original website had only reached 4.18 out of 7 on the USE questionnaire.




## Process

The traditional human-centred design approach was adjusted to fit the setting, as the project is based on the already established mobile version of dndbeyond.com.
Because of this, the project began by user testing the established mobile version of the website, in which XX participants were given 13 tasks, which were designed to cover most activities a D&amp;D player would encounter during an average playing session. Afterwards, the players were interviewed about their experiences and then given the USE questionnaire. These insights were then used to create a medium-fidelity prototype, which was tested under the same conditions as the website. This already allowed for initial comparisons and showed that even the medium-fidelity prototype had scored significantly higher than the website. These insights were then used to create an improved, final high-fidelity prototype.

In the final testing stage, a total of XX participants were recruited and were tasked to play a normal 3-hour session of D&amp;D using both the website and the final prototype as character sheets consecutively. They were asked to rate the tools based on the USE questionnaire, and group interviews were held in which both tools were  discussed, compared and final input was given.




## Prototype

The prototypes were created using Figma, with the final prototype being functional enough to allow for 1.5 hours of  D&amp;D gameplay without problems. 
The final Prototype can be accessed [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/KHSKQkQkVz6cGlRBcFBM8d/DnDBeyond-Rework---DRUID?node-id=1-2&starting-point-node-id=1%3A2&t=gctSr9aCa0b66nEh-1).

The main issues that were identified and improved within this project are:
- More intuitive information placement
- Improving and simplifying Navigation
- Predigesting Informaiton
- Reducing unneeded Information
- Creating more adaptivity for special cases
- Giving access to all needed resources

Below, example screenshots of the prototype interface can be found.

## Results

Overall, both the high-fidelity and the medium-fidelity prototypes were rated higher by the participants than the original website, even when put in direct comparison to each other.

### Lab-based testing
The image below visualises the results of the first two testing stages, in which both the website and the medium-fidelity prototype were tested based on pre-defined tasks.

### Field-based testing 
The image velow visualises the results of the final testing stage, in which participants used both the website and the high-fidelity prototype within a real, ~3 hour long  D&amp;D session.
